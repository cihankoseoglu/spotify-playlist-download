Application for downloading spotify playlists from multiple torrent files.

## Idea
We all love using Spotify, but there are cases where we need our music on devices which doesn't have Spotify, but just plain old mp3 files. But we have all of our awesome playlists created in Spotify, so this app will come in help to try to find and download each song across torrents for use.

Created with the main reason to see whether i can code it or not while trying out and learning new frameworks, tools.
